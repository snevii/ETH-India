<h1>IPfy</h1>
<h5>IPfy is platform to list and license copyrighted and patented work. <br/><h3>Problems with current ways</h3>
1. IP registering and licensing is a resource intensive task often requiring expensive legal assistance.
2. Addtionally, creators who provide open source creations/inventions are not appropriately attributed and rewarded. 
3. It is difficult to asses the vallidity of new inventons and creations.

<br/><br/>
IPfy records registered IP on blockchain and faciliated licensing of IP in one simple step. Potential Licensors and licensees have a chat function to communicate for clarifactions. The above stated problems are thus resolved:
1. External invervention can be avoided, by automating the licensing process. The creator must only provide details of their IP and its curresponding registration ID. Addtionally, for creators/inventors who want to register their property, but don't have the means to do so with a govt./govt. recognised authority, they may record it on the platform and have a timestamped proof of their creation, serving as reliable evidence. 
2. Creators who publish license fee free work, to promote innovation, shall be attributed if other users use their work. Any person(s) creating new work created relying on anr open source work, will display the open source invention/creation card on their profile. Users are also given the CHOICE to make small payments to suppport the open source creators/inventors. 
3. Potential popularity and utility of the invention/creation may be identified by evaluating the transaction history of the license, recorded on the blockchain.

  <h3>Buisness Model</h3>
  <br/>
A small percentage of the license fee will go to the IPfy.
